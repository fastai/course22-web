In this course, containing over 30 hours of video content, we implement the astounding [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) algorithm from scratch! That's the [killer app](https://www.pcworld.com/article/916785/creating-ai-art-local-pc-stable-diffusion.html) that made the [internet freak out](https://devops.com/stable-diffusion-public-richixbw/), and caused the media to say "[you may never believe what you see online again](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/)".

We've worked closely with experts from Stability.ai and Hugging Face (creators of the Diffusers library) to ensure we have rigorous coverage of the latest techniques. The course includes coverage of papers that were released after Stable Diffusion came out -- so it actually goes well beyond even what Stable Diffusion includes! We also explain how to read research papers, and practice this skill by studying and implementing many papers throughout the course.

Stable diffusion, and diffusion methods in general, are a great learning goal for many reasons. For one thing, of course, you can create amazing stuff with these algorithms! To really take the technique to the next level, and create things that no-one has seen before, you need to really deeply understand what's happening under the hood. With this understanding, you can craft your own loss functions, initialization methods, multi-model mixups, and more, to create totally new applications that have never been seen before. Just as important: it's a great learning goal because nearly every key technique in modern deep learning comes together in these methods. Contrastive learning, transformer models, auto-encoders, CLIP embeddings, latent variables, u-nets, resnets, and much more are involved in creating a single image.

To get the most out of this course, you should be a reasonably confident deep learning practitioner. If you've finished fast.ai's [Practical Deep Learning](https://course.fast.ai/) course then you'll be ready! If you haven't done that course, but are comfortable with building an SGD training loop from scratch in Python, being competitive in Kaggle competitions, using modern NLP and computer vision algorithms for practical problems, and working with PyTorch and fastai, then you will be ready to start the course. (If you're not sure, then we strongly recommend getting starting with *Practical Deep Learning*.)

## Content summary

In this course, we'll explore diffusion methods such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM). We'll get our hands dirty implementing unconditional and conditional diffusion models, experimenting with different samplers, and diving into recent tricks like textual inversion and Dreambooth.

Along the way, we'll cover essential deep learning topics like neural network architectures, data augmentation approaches, and various loss functions. We'll build our own models from scratch, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), ResNets, and Unets, while experimenting with generative architectures like autoencoders and transformers.

Throughout the course, we'll use PyTorch to implement our models, and will create our own deep learning framework called `miniai`. We'll master Python concepts like iterators, generators, and decorators to keep our code clean and efficient. We'll also explore deep learning optimizers like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) accelerated approaches, learning rate annealing, and learning how to experiment with the impact different initialisers, batch sizes and learning rates. And of course, we'll make use of handy tools like the Python debugger (pdb) and nbdev for building Python modules from Jupyter notebooks.

Lastly, we'll touch on fundamental concepts like tensors, calculus, and pseudo-random number generation to provide a solid foundation for our exploration. We'll apply these concepts to machine learning techniques like mean shift clustering and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and will see how to use tracking with Weights and Biases (W&B).

We'll also tackle mixed precision training using both NVIDIA's apex library, and the Accelerate library from Hugging Face. We'll investigate various types of normalization like Layer Normalization and Batch Normalization. By the end of the course, you'll have a deep understanding of diffusion models and the skills to implement cutting-edge deep learning techniques.

(The "topics covered" list was taken from the concatenation of the topic list of each lesson, and using GPT 4 with this prompt: "*The input text contains a markdown list of topics discussed in a number of deep learning and stable diffusion lessons. The topics from each lesson were concatenated together into this list, therefore it may contain duplicates (or near dupes) and is not well organised. Create an organised markdown list which groups similar topics together (using a hierarchy or markdown list items as appropriate) and combine duplicate or very similar topics.*" The "content summary" section was taken from the "topics covered" list, and the GPT 4 prompt "*Summarise the following markdown course outline using 3-4 paragraphs of informal prose in the style of Jeremy Howard.
