title: "Lesson 2"
---

*Daniel 深度碎片* on [forums.fast.ai](https://forums.fast.ai) has been kind enough to create summaries, in the form of a list of questions, of every lesson. You can use these summaries to remind yourself what you learned in each lesson, or to preview a lesson before you watch it. Here's the lesson 2 summary:

- New exciting content to come
  - Can there be substantial new content given we have already 4 versions and a book?
- Ways of reading the book
  - How many channels available for us to read the book? (physical, github, colab and others)
- Extra sweets from the book
  - Are there interesting materials/stories covered by the book not the lecture?
  - Where can you find questionnaires and quizzes of the lectures?
- aiquizzes.com
  - Where can you get more quizzes of fastai and memorize them forever?
- Introducing the forum
  - How to make the most out of fastai forum?
- Students' works after week 1
- A Wow moment
  - Will we learn to put model in production today?
- Find a problem and some data
  - What is the first step before building a model?
- Access to the magics of Jupyter notebook
  - Do you want to navigate the notebook with a TOC?
  - How about collapsable sections?
  - How about moving between start and end of sections fast?
  - How to install jupyter extensions
- Download and clean your data
  - Why use ggd rather than bing for searching and downloading images?
  - How to clean/remove broken images?
- Get to docs quickly
  - How to get basic info, source code, full docs on fastai codes quickly?
- Resize your data before training
  - How can you specify the resize options to your data?
  - Why should we always use RandomResizedCrop and `aug_transforms` together?
  - How RandomResizedCrop and `aug_transforms` differ?
- Data images instantly transformed not copied
  - When resized, are we making many copies of the image?
- More epochs for fancy resize
  - How many epochs do we usually go when using RandomResizedCrop and `aug_transforms`?
- Confusion matrix: where do models get wrong the most?
  - How to create confusion matrix on your model performance?
  - When to use confusion matrix? (category)-practice
  - How to interpret confusion matrix?
  - What is the most obvious thing does it tell us?
  - How hard is it to tell grizzly and black bears apart?
- Check out images with worse predictions
  - Do `plot_top_losses` give us the images with highest losses?
  - Are those images merely ones the model made confidently wrong prediction?-practice
  - Do those images include ones that the model made right prediction unconfidently?
  - What does looking at those high loss images help? (get expert examination or simple data cleaning)
- What if you want to clean the data a little
  - How to display and make cleaning choices on each of those top loss images in each data folder?-practice
  - Without expert knowledge on telling apart grizzly and black bears, at least we can clean images which mess up teddy bears.
- Myth breaker: train model and then clean data
  - How can training the model help us see the problem of dataset?-practice
  - Won't we have more ideas to improve the dataset once we spot the problems of the dataset?
- Turn off GPU when not using
  - How to use GPU RAM locally without much trouble?
- Watch first, then watch and code along
  - What is the preferred way of lecture watching and coding by majority of students?
- A Gradio + hugging face tutorial
- Git and Github desk
  - Is Github desk a less cool but easier and more robust way to version control than git?
- Terminal for windows
  - How to set up terminal for windows?
  - Why Jeremy prefer windows than mac?
- Get started with Hugging Face Spaces
  - go to huggingface.co/spaces and create a new space
- Get the default App up and running
  - How to use git to download your space folder?
  - How to open vscode to add app.py file?
  - How to use vscode to push your space folder up to hugging face spaces online?
  - then go back to your space on Hugging Face to see the app running
- Train and download your model
  - Where is the model we are going to train and download from Kaggle notebook?
  - How to export your model after trained it on Kaggle?
  - Where do you download the model?
  - How to open a folder in terminal? `open .`
  - Make sure the model is downloaded into its own Hugging Face Space folder
- Predict with loaded model
  - How to load downloaded model to make prediction?
  - How to make prediction with the loaded model?
  - How to export selected cells of a jupyter notebook into a python file?
  - How to see how long a code runs in a jupyter cell?
- Turn your model into Gradio App locally
  - How to prepare your prediction result into a form gradio prefers? #code
  - How to build a gradio interface for your model?
  - How to launch your app with the model locally?
  - Not in video: run the code on Kaggle in cloud
- Push this app onto Hugging Face Spaces
  - Make sure to create a new space first, e.g., testing
  - How to turn the notebook into a python script?
  - How to push the folder up to github and run app in cloud?

- How many epochs are ideal for fine tuning?
- How to save model from colab?
- How to install fastai properly
  - How to download github/fastai/fastsetup using git? `git clone https://github.com/fastai/fastsetup.git`
